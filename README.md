"Users/thomasmcquaid/SAMPLELIBRARY": An exploration of musical definition using my personal sample collection

This code will concatonate every useable audio file in a given directory to a single audio file, which can then be edited and manipulated further using software such as Audacity. This is done as a criticism of restrictive musical definitions, Irving Godt states music should be "humanly organised" and "organised with intent", and as my sample library is both humanly organised and organised with intent, it meets to requirements to be considered music under Godt's definition
